For example, the optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply Aragorn's attack 3 to an enemy's 1 defense. So Aragorn is dealing 2 damage to the enemy and Dwalin is also dealing 2 damage, at which point you play Heavy Stroke to double Dwalin's damage and make it 4 for a total of 6 damage dealt to the enemy.\n\nJust to clarify it further, let's say Aragorn and Dwalin were attacking an enemy with 4 defense. The optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply all 3 of Aragron's attack plus 1 of Dwalin's to beating the enemy's defense, then Dwalin would deal 1 damage to the enemy that could be double with Heavy Stroke for a total of 2.
